# GarageManagement-
Project Management Garage Part 1 - The first part of the work is designed to practice object-oriented programming
and we work with the console application to practice as much as possible the problem of code duplication.
The score will decrease if there is a code duplication!!!.
Note that this work is forbidden to work with DELEGATE, INTERFACE, AND EXCEPTION.

Project Management Garage Part 2 - Add DELEGATE, INTERFACE, AND EXCEPTION (Will be coming soon)

Project Management Garage Part 3- Build a UI to work with WPF, and add design pattern (Will be coming soon) 

Project Management Garage Part 4 - Working with databases and unit test (Will be coming soon)
